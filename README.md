# Customer_Churn_Prediction
Customer Churn Prediction of a telecom company. 


â€”Customer churning refers to phenomena in which customer quits a particular subscription and moving towards some other service providers resulting a huge loss to company.Now retaining old customers becomes more important than acquiring new ones and this led to a need for the efficient machinelearning model to predict customer churn. In this project we are working on telecom dataset in which we are working on data mining, date preprocessing and feature engineering to select and extract important feature and also reducing the size of overall data set then we will predict customer churn through Machine learning techniques to get least FP rate in less time with more accuracy
